#### More about HTML

!(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#/media/File:HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg)

[*Hypertext Markup Language*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With [*Cascading Style Sheets*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) (CSS) and [*JavaScript*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
