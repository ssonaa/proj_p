[*Hypertext Markup Language*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "Link to HTML") (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With [*Cascading Style Sheets*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets "Link to CSS") (CSS) and [*JavaScript*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "Link to JavaScript"), it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
